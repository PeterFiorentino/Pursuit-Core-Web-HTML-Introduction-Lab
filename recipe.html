    <hr>
    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound thin asparagus spears</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices eureka! Organic Bread</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup nonfat milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives</li>
      </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4> Directions </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Place one rack in the center of your oven and the other towards the top (I did the second from the topmost). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lay
          the asparagus in the center of a baking sheet, drizzle with the olive oil, and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Toss to coat,
          then spread the spears into a single layer. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes on the center rack, until the asparagus is crisp-tender. Remove the baking sheet
          from the oven, then turn the oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Arrange the bread slices on a second baking sheet. Broil on the upper rack for 30 seconds to a few minutes, until golden (watch carefully so the bread
          doesn't burn—the time can vary greatly by broiler. Don't walk away!), then flip the slices and toast the other side. Remove from the oven and set
          aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, beat the eggs, milk, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a figure 8 pattern until completely
          blended. In a medium nonstick pan, melt the butter over medium-low. Once the butter has melted, reduce the heat to low and add the beaten eggs. Let cook,
          stirring very gently with a silicone spatula. Continuing cooking, stirring the eggs gently and often to keep them moving, until they are cooked but still
          soft, about 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the Parmesan and chives. Taste and add additional salt and/or pepper as desired. To serve, top each slice of toast
          with a big scoop of scrambled eggs and a handful of asparagus spears. Sprinkle with additional Parmesan and/or chives as desired. Enjoy immediately. </li>
      </ol>
